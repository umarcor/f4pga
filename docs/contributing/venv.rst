Packages in virtual environment
###############################

To install packages in conda environment you can use both
``conda`` and ``pip``.

Note that ``pip`` is installed in the conda environment which uses ``python3``,
and is related to ``pip3`` **inside** the virtual environment,
whereas invocation of ``pip3`` directly uses your **system** ``pip3`` instance,
typically located in ``/usr/bin/pip3``
